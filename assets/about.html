<h1>MLB for MWM</h1>
<p>The MLBScoreWidget displays game data information for a particular Major League Baseball team.
<p>The user picks a team from by selecting the button displaying a MLB Team name. 
The teams are listed alphabetically with no organization for league or division.
<p> Then enter the time between score updates, in minutes, in the Edit box. The default
is two minutes.
<p>A typical
half inning takes ten minutes so a two minute interval should cover every out 
without pulling data from the server too often. Until the game starts, the score 
server is not polled.
<p> Then select the "Start Widget" button to have MetaWatch Manager start displaying
the widget on your watch.
<p>The widget is 48 pixels wide and 32 pixels high which is half a row on a digital 
watch. On a day when the team is not playing, the team name is printed at the
top of the widget and NONE, in a large font, is printed below the name. On
a day the team is playing, but before the game starts, three letter names for 
the teams are printed on the first line with the visiting team on the left. 
Below the team names, the start time for the game is printed using the time zone where the
watch is, not the game. After the
game starts, the team scores are printed below the names. To the right of the
score and centered vertically, the inning appears. During the top of the inning,
the number of outs is displayed above the inning. Outs are below the inning in the bottom
half. When the game finishes, the inning is replaced with F.
<p>The final score is displayed until some time past 10AM of the next day when the
score is replaced with either the start time for that day or NONE. 
<p>The three letter designation for a team is location based rather than team name based.
For example, the Atlanta Braves uses ATL. The Los Angeles Dodgers uses LAD. 
<p>The score data is pulled from:
http://gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/year_yyyy/month_mm/day_dd/scoreboard.xml
Where year, yyyy, month, mm, and day, dd, are extracted from the current date.
This file is generally less than 10K in size. For a three hour game, and a two minute
interval between updates, the file 
will be fetched 90 times for a total of nearly 1MB. During the season, a team plays 
fewer than 30 games per month. 30MB would be more than 10% of a 200MB/month 
data plan.
